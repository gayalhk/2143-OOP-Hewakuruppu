**Definitions**

**Class**

A Class is a user defined data-type which has data members and member functions.

**Object**

An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

**Method**

A method of a class is a function that has its definition or its prototype within the class definition like any other variable. It operates on any object of the class of which it is a member, and has access to all the members of a class for that object.

**Abstraction**

abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details.

**Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data.

**Polymorphism**

polymorphism is when a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function.

**Overloading**

Overloading is specifying more than one definition for a function name or an operator in the same scope.

**Attributes/properties**

Attribute denotes a part of an aggregate object, and so is used during analysis as well as design to express a singular property of the class.Property is a broad concept used to denote a particular characteristic of a class, encompassing both its attributes and its relationships to other classes.

**Class Variable**

Class variable is an attribute defined in a class of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist. So all instances of that class share its value as well as its declaration.

**Instance Variable**

 An instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance.
 
 **Member Variable**
 
 A member variable is a variable that is part of a class.
 
 **Inheritance**
 
 Inheritance defining a class in terms of another class, which makes it easier to create and maintain an application.
 
 **Multiple Inheritance**
 
 Multiple inheritance is when a C++ class can inherit members from more than one class.
 
 **Composition**
 
 Object Composition is a C++ context that allows us to create complex classes by combining simpler, more easily manageable parts.
